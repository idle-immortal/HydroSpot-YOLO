# HydroSpot-YOLO-Real-Time-Water-Hyacinth-Detection-in-Complex-Water-Environments

HydroSpot-YOLO is an advanced object detection model designed to monitor water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in natural aquatic environments. Based on the YOLOv8 framework, it integrates an Attentional Scale Sequence Fusion (ASF) mechanism and a P2 detection layer to improve the detection of small objects, even in challenging conditions like water reflections, environmental clutter, and varying light levels. This project is aimed at real-time, scalable monitoring of water hyacinth, contributing to invasive species management and ecological restoration.

## Key Features:
- **YOLOv8-based Model**: Leverages the latest YOLOv8 architecture, optimized for both speed and accuracy.
- **Attentional Scale Sequence Fusion (ASF)**: Improves detection performance for small, complex objects.
- **P2 Detection Layer**: Enhances the modelâ€™s ability to detect small targets, particularly in dynamic water environments.
- **Specialized Dataset**: A custom dataset derived from real surveillance footage, ensuring robust performance across varying environmental conditions, lighting, and water hyacinth densities.
